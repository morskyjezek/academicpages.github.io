Library Carpentry, a mode of instruction designed on the principles of participation and live coding developed by The Carpentries, presents an active curriculum for librarians to expand their digital skills. I first got involved with this professional workshop approach at the Library of Congress in 2018, and I have since taught workshops in-person and online, for learners at the Smithsonian, American University, Clemson University, and the U.S. Geological Survey. 

Here are the workshop programs and topics: 

* [2020 workshop at Clemson University](https://shlake.github.io/2020-12-01-Clemson-online-NNLM/)
* [2020 workshop at American University](https://elnazamanzadeh.github.io/2020-11-09-american-online/)
* [2019 workshop at the Library of Congress](https://morskyjezek.github.io/2019-09-24-libraryofcongress/)
* [2018 workshop at the Library of Congress](https://libcce.github.io/2018-09-18-LC/) (instructor in training)
