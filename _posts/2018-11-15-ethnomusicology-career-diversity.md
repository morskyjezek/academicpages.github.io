Good morning everyone! I’d like to thank Dave for organizing this panel, and Dwan for chairing. I think those of us up here today have known each other in various capacities, but working somewhat externally to the discipline proper, we don’t always get the chance to see each other and interact a whole lot. So it’s a pleasure to be here. 

First I'll say a bit about ”how I got here”. Then, I'm going to share some thoughts on what "career diversity" might look like in ethnomusicology, explore ways that changes in the discipline and scholarly communication can encourage increased career diversity, and finally to share my perspective on career diversity as I saw it as a funder at the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).

## Where did we come from and where are we going?

This essay is a light revision of a talk that I gave at the Society for
Ethnomusicology's 63rd Annual Meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico. My thanks are due to the panel organizer, Dave Lewis, and co-panelist Rebekah Moore, and our wonderful panel chairperson, Dwandalyn Reece of the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture.
