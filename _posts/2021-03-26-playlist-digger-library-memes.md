There's a freighter stuck in the Suez Canal. It's thought the ship was blown off 
course a few days ago, and it's become a meme. I noticed this on Wednesday, when the BBC [reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56505413) that: 

> A giant container ship the length of four football pitches has become wedged across Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes.

Obviously this was waiting to go viral. @jdgtranen recaptioned the photo
with the BBC logo, combining it with the lyrics from WAP:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">when Cardi B said ‚Äú I want you to park that Big Mack Truck right in this little garage‚Äù....the Suez Canal FELT that üò§üò§ <a href="https://t.co/lz8xvYT7qW">pic.twitter.com/lz8xvYT7qW</a></p>&mdash; joshua gutterman tranen (@jdgtranen) <a href="https://twitter.com/jdgtranen/status/1375276456373288960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Memes don't always attract the attention
of library twitter! But this one did as soon as another photo started to get attention. 
It turns out that the engineers didn't really have a great hi-tec solution for this problem, 
in fact they were sending earth-moving machines to remove sand from the bow of the
ship. Well, even a giant backhoe, digger, or dump truck is dwarfed by a ship the 
length of four football fields that can carry 20,000 truck-sized containers! The 
photo that caught attention is this one, of the lone digger:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Managed to dig out good part of the bulbous thingy. It&#39;s still stuck. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Evergiven?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Evergiven</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuezCanal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SuezCanal</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Suez?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Suez</a> <a href="https://t.co/zbeD59LA6V">pic.twitter.com/zbeD59LA6V</a></p>&mdash; Guy With The Digger At Suez Canal (@SuezDiggerGuy) <a href="https://twitter.com/SuezDiggerGuy/status/1375025667503501312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

(Yes, there's at least one account tweeting from the perspective of the digger [@SuezDiggerGuy](https://twitter.com/SuezDiggerGuy/).) 

The tiny digger, working away in its Sisyphean task of removing the sand become a great metaphor for 
various aspects of library work... here's a few faves from the past day.

An image meme from @vwyeth shows the paradigm: huge problems (here it's the 
ship denoted with the text "Structural Problem") confronted by tiny, possibly 
ineffective or mismatched, solutions (in this case, suggesting that one 
person making one small change won't change "the system"):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok I like this one even better. <a href="https://t.co/fRCRlTT3WO">pic.twitter.com/fRCRlTT3WO</a></p>&mdash; Vanessa Wyeth (@vwyeth) <a href="https://twitter.com/vwyeth/status/1375104042897178624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Or this shared by @SgWingo, suggesting the hollowness of naive advice
in the face of the overwhelming pandemic:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">Yup. <a href="https://t.co/QMHxI9fTWF">pic.twitter.com/QMHxI9fTWF</a></p>&mdash; Sarah Wingo (@SgWingo) <a href="https://twitter.com/SgWingo/status/1375285799160225802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There are a few that  library work, perhaps symbolized by the never-ending, often-thankless, and 
frequently-invisible work of maintenance, might be like the digger. 
Here @sonicstacey offers this picture as a metaphor for the inadequate
budgets that memory institutions often make available for digital preservation: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">not sure if I did this right <a href="https://t.co/znJNoFYkSt">pic.twitter.com/znJNoFYkSt</a></p>&mdash; üñ• terminal boredom üíæ (@sonicstacey) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstacey/status/1375362934545608704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Or perhaps, as @remembrancermx points out, the problem is the inadequate staffing?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did I do it right? <a href="https://t.co/sHKQJBYJA1">pic.twitter.com/sHKQJBYJA1</a></p>&mdash; Yonah (@remembrancermx) <a href="https://twitter.com/remembrancermx/status/1375185541046538241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There's a second layer of memes embedded here, as many users tweet the image 
with something like "hope i did this right..." encouraging others to respond
with other images, encouragement, or different takes.
