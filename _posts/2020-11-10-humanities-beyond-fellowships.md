Researchers in the arts and humanities often seek support for individual work through fellowships and other awards that support single investigators. This approach to work is supported by funders through programs like the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) [Fellowships](https://www.neh.gov/grants/research/fellowships), and by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) [creative writing support](https://www.arts.gov/grants/creative-writing-fellowships). In fact, in some cases these awards are synonymous with grants: Iâ€™ve had many conversations with people who talk about "getting an NEH," in reference to someone receiving a fellowship award from the NEH.

When I talk with researchers about pursuing external support for work in the arts and humanities, I often start by explaining that even though these sorts of awards receive a lot of attention, they actually comprise only a small portion of the funds that either of these federal funders awards. In fact, the majority of funding goes toward collaborative, multi-year projects that support a range of activities. For example, the NEH awards as many (or more) dollars for programs that support the creation of research tools like reference resources, the creation of deeply researched and referenced media productions (i.e., non-book publications), and the enhancement of curriculum by humanities scholars; likewise, the NEA supports many community partnerships and research work that investigates the social and economic benefits of arts activity. Researchers in the arts and humanities can expand their funding possibilities by thinking as expansively and creatively as possible about the range of products that their research may produce, and the wider audiences and impacts of their work!

Earlier this year, I presented "Strategies for Federal Humanities and Arts Funding," a webinar that offers more details on how researchers and potential applicants can approach these sorts of questions. The webinar includes an overview of a few NEH and NEA current programs. You can view the slides for this webinar at http://myumi.ch/DE8og, or view the video at https://youtu.be/38u7m9Zzrfo.

Researchers at University of Michigan are also welcome to get in touch with the Research Development team to discuss any arts or humanities related grant proposals, and more: https://research.umich.edu/research-development.
